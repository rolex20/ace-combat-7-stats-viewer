# [Ace Combat 7 - Interactive Aircraft Statistics Viewer](https://rolex20.github.io/ace-combat-7-stats-viewer/AC7-Stats.html)

This is a lightweight, single-page web application that provides a comprehensive and interactive data table of all player-usable aircraft in *Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown*. The application allows players to dynamically sort aircraft statistics to easily compare performance, weaponry, and unlock conditions, serving as a quick and efficient in-game reference tool.

This project serves as a demonstration of core front-end development principles, built entirely with vanilla web technologies. It showcases proficiency in **modern JavaScript (ES6+)** for creating dynamic user interfaces, including direct **DOM manipulation** for client-side rendering, efficient data handling, and implementation of event-driven features like multi-column sorting. The application is styled with **modern, embedded CSS** for a clean and responsive user experience, all delivered within a self-contained, dependency-free HTML file, highlighting an understanding of performance and portability.

### Features

-   **Complete Aircraft Data:** Includes all base-game and DLC aircraft with detailed performance stats, weapon types, ammunition counts, and unlock requirements.
-   **Interactive Sorting:** Click on any column header to sort the entire table by that statistic. Click again to toggle between ascending and descending order.
-   **Static Record Counter:** A non-sortable first column provides a stable row number for easy reference.
-   **Zero Dependencies:** The application runs entirely in the browser with no need for external libraries, frameworks, or internet connection.
-   **Single-File and Portable:** The entire application is contained in a single HTML file, making it easy to download, share, and use offline.
-   **Fast & Lightweight:** Optimized for performance by embedding minified data directly, ensuring instant load times.
